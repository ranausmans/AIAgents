        Based on this traffic summary and data:

        Summary: {traffic_summary}
        Data: {traffic_data}

        Provide specific, actionable signal timing adjustments for each intersection. For each adjustment:
        1. Calculate a new green light duration based on the current traffic level and vehicle count.
        2. Specify any changes to the traffic flow pattern (e.g., lane prioritization, turn restrictions).
        3. Briefly explain the expected impact of these changes.

        Use the following guidelines for green light duration:
        - Low traffic: 30-45 seconds
        - Medium traffic: 45-60 seconds
        - High traffic: 60-90 seconds

        Adjust these base times according to the specific vehicle count and average speed.

        Format the response as follows for each intersection:
        - Intersection Name:
          Action: [Specific signal timing change and traffic flow adjustment]
          Expected Impact: [Brief explanation of the expected result]

        Focus on data-driven, quantitative adjustments that directly address the current traffic situation.
