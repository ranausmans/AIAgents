# AI Traffic Agents - A Concept for Smarter Urban Mobility

This project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can work together to solve real-world traffic problems. While not a production solution, it showcases the potential of agent-based systems for managing traffic in cities like NYC. Through simulation, we explore how different agents collaborate to monitor traffic, adjust signals, provide public announcements, and predict future congestion.

## üö¶ Agents Overview

The system consists of four AI agents that communicate and collaborate in real-time to optimize traffic flow:

1. **Traffic Monitoring Agent**  
   Monitors traffic conditions such as congestion levels, vehicle count, and average speeds at key intersections.

2. **Smart Signal Control Agent**  
   Adjusts traffic signal timing based on real-time congestion data to alleviate bottlenecks and improve vehicle flow.

3. **Public Announcement Agent**  
   Provides real-time traffic alerts to commuters, suggesting alternative routes or public transit options.

4. **Predictive Traffic Analysis Agent**  
   Predicts future traffic conditions based on historical and real-time data, allowing proactive adjustments to traffic management.

## üöó How It Works

The agents collaborate in the following ways:

- **Detecting Bottlenecks**  
   The Traffic Monitoring Agent identifies congestion points in real-time.
   
- **Optimizing Traffic Flow**  
   The Smart Signal Control Agent adjusts green light durations and implements lane prioritization based on traffic conditions.

- **Proactive Public Communication**  
   The Public Announcement Agent informs commuters about traffic hotspots and suggests alternate routes or transit options.

- **Forecasting Congestion**  
   The Predictive Traffic Analysis Agent uses past and present data to predict future congestion, allowing for timely interventions.

## üöÄ Want to Contribute?

This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repo, improve the system, or even integrate a live Traffic API to see the agents in action on real-world data.
